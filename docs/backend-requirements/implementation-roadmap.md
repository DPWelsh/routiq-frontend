# Backend Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the phased approach for implementing backend APIs to replace dummy data in the Routiq frontend application. The migration is structured into 5 phases, prioritized by business impact and technical dependencies.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Replace hardcoded dummy data with real backend API integration  
**Total Estimated Effort**: 8-12 weeks  
**Critical Success Factors**: Dashboard functionality, conversation management, patient data accuracy

## Phase Priority Matrix

| Phase | Priority | Estimated Effort | Business Impact | Technical Risk |
|-------|----------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Phase 1: Dashboard Analytics | **High** | 2-3 weeks | **Critical** | Low |
| Phase 2: Unified Messaging | **High** | 2-3 weeks | **Critical** | Medium |
| Phase 3: Patient Insights | **Medium** | 2-3 weeks | **High** | Medium |
| Phase 4: Integrations | **Low** | 1-2 weeks | **Medium** | Low |
| Phase 5: Settings | **Low** | 1-2 weeks | **Low** | Low |

## Immediate Priority (Weeks 1-6)

### Phase 1: Dashboard Analytics
**Status**: Must implement immediately  
**Reason**: Dashboard shows hardcoded values that mislead users

**Critical Issues**:
- Dashboard displays "247 bookings, 89 patients, 284% ROI" as static values
- Users cannot trust the data for business decisions
- Core functionality appears broken

**Required Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/{organizationId}/analytics`
- Basic metrics: bookings, patients, revenue, ROI

**Success Criteria**:
- Dashboard shows real data instead of hardcoded values
- Metrics update based on actual business activity
- Users can trust the displayed information

---

### Phase 2: Unified Messaging
**Status**: Must implement immediately  
**Reason**: Inbox is completely non-functional

**Critical Issues**:
- Inbox uses `/api/placeholder/conversations/phone` returning mock data
- No real conversation history or patient communication
- Core messaging feature is broken

**Required Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/conversations/{organizationId}`
- `GET /api/v1/conversations/{organizationId}/phone/{phone}`
- `GET /api/v1/conversations/{organizationId}/stats`

**Success Criteria**:
- Real conversation list loads in inbox
- Individual conversations show actual message history
- Navigation badges show accurate unread counts

## Secondary Priority (Weeks 7-12)

### Phase 3: Patient Insights
**Status**: High value, can be deferred after Phases 1 & 2  
**Reason**: Patient management works with mock data but lacks real insights

**Current Issues**:
- Patient components use hardcoded mock data
- Risk analysis shows fake percentages
- No real patient journey tracking

**Required Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/patients/{organizationId}/profiles`
- `GET /api/v1/patients/{organizationId}/risk-summary`
- `GET /api/v1/patients/{organizationId}/profile/{patientId}`

**Success Criteria**:
- Real patient profiles replace mock data
- Risk analysis shows calculated percentages
- Patient insights reflect actual engagement

## Deferred Priority (Weeks 13+)

### Phase 4: Connected Services
**Status**: Enhancement phase  
**Reason**: Integration monitoring improves operations but isn't core functionality

**Current State**: Static integration status display  
**Future State**: Real integration health monitoring

### Phase 5: System Configuration
**Status**: Enhancement phase  
**Reason**: Settings work as UI-only; data persistence is nice-to-have

**Current State**: Static settings interface  
**Future State**: Persistent organization and user configuration

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Integration Complexity**

   - Mitigation: Implement data validation and reconciliation

2. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - Risk: Slow API responses with large patient/conversation datasets
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination, caching, and indexing

3. **HIPAA Compliance**
   - Risk: Patient data exposure or non-compliance
   - Mitigation: Security review, audit logging, encryption

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Real-time Updates**
   - Risk: Complex implementation for real-time dashboard updates
   - Mitigation: Start with polling, implement WebSockets later

2. **Multi-platform Messaging**

## Conclusion

This phased approach ensures that critical functionality (dashboard and messaging) is restored quickly while allowing for systematic implementation of enhanced features. The priority ordering maximizes business value while managing technical risk and development complexity.

The backend team should focus on Phases 1 and 2 as the immediate priority, as these address the most critical user-facing issues where the frontend is currently non-functional or misleading.
