# Backend Requirements Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive backend API requirements for migrating the Routiq frontend from dummy data to real backend integration. The documentation is organized into phase-based implementation guides that can be shared with the backend development team.

## Document Structure

### Core Implementation Phases

1. **[Phase 1: Dashboard Analytics](./phase-1-dashboard-analytics.md)**
   - **Priority**: High (Critical)
   - **Effort**: 2-3 weeks
   - **Purpose**: Replace hardcoded dashboard metrics with real data
   - **Impact**: Dashboard currently shows static values (247 bookings, 89 patients, 284% ROI)

2. **[Phase 2: Unified Messaging](./phase-2-unified-messaging.md)**
   - **Priority**: High (Critical)
   - **Effort**: 2-3 weeks
   - **Purpose**: Replace placeholder conversation APIs with real messaging data
   - **Impact**: Inbox is completely non-functional without real conversation data

3. **[Phase 3: Patient Insights](./phase-3-patient-insights.md)**
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Effort**: 2-3 weeks
   - **Purpose**: Replace mock patient data with real patient profiles and analytics
   - **Impact**: Patient management uses placeholder data

4. **[Phase 4: Connected Services](./phase-4-integrations.md)**
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Effort**: 1-2 weeks
   - **Purpose**: Replace static integration status with real health monitoring
   - **Impact**: Integration monitoring is enhancement, not core functionality

5. **[Phase 5: System Configuration](./phase-5-settings.md)**
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Effort**: 1-2 weeks
   - **Purpose**: Replace static settings UI with persistent configuration
   - **Impact**: Settings work as UI-only currently

### Planning Documents

- **[Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)**
  - Executive summary and phase prioritization
  - Week-by-week implementation strategy
  - Risk mitigation and success metrics
  - Technical dependencies and requirements

## Quick Start Guide

### For Backend Team Leads
1. Start with the [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md) for project overview
2. Focus on Phase 1 and Phase 2 documents for immediate implementation
3. Review technical dependencies and security requirements
4. Plan resource allocation based on estimated effort

### For Backend Developers
1. Review the specific phase document you're assigned to implement
2. Pay attention to the "Critical API Endpoints Required" section
3. Implement the "Required Response Schema" exactly as specified
4. Test against the "Success Criteria" checklist
5. Defer "Nice-to-Have Enhancements" until critical features are complete

## Key Considerations

### Critical Issues to Address
- **Dashboard**: Shows hardcoded values that mislead users
- **Messaging**: Inbox completely broken with placeholder APIs
- **Patient Data**: Risk analysis uses fake percentages

### Technical Requirements
- Organization-based data isolation
- HIPAA compliance for patient data
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Real-time updates where specified
- Comprehensive error handling

### Security & Compliance
- All patient data must be HIPAA compliant
- Organization-level access controls required
- Audit logging for all data access
- Encryption for sensitive information

## Implementation Priority

```
IMMEDIATE (Weeks 1-6):
├── Phase 1: Dashboard Analytics
└── Phase 2: Unified Messaging

SECONDARY (Weeks 7-12):
└── Phase 3: Patient Insights

DEFERRED (Weeks 13+):
├── Phase 4: Connected Services
└── Phase 5: System Configuration
```

## API Standards

### Common Patterns
- All endpoints use `/api/v1/` prefix
- Organization ID is path parameter: `/{organizationId}`
- Consistent error response format
- ISO timestamp format for all dates
- Pagination for large datasets

### Authentication
- Organization-level access control
- User permission validation
- API rate limiting
- Secure token management

## Support and Questions

### Frontend Integration Points
- Each phase document lists "Frontend Components Affected"
- Response schemas are designed to match existing frontend expectations
- Breaking changes are minimized to reduce frontend modifications

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all calculation logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance tests with realistic data volumes
- Security tests for data access controls

## Document Updates

These documents are living specifications that should be updated as:
- API designs are refined during implementation
- Frontend requirements change
- New business requirements emerge
- Security or compliance requirements evolve

---

**Note**: This is a research and planning document set. The actual implementation should follow these specifications while adapting to specific technical constraints and business requirements discovered during development.
