# Routiq Dashboard Backend Integration Review
## Technical Questions & Architecture Planning

**Context:** We're building an AI-powered layer on top of Cliniko/Nookal with the mission to "always look to highlight data that Cliniko doesn't track - create a feeling of it being 'live'."

**Frontend Status:** Phase 1 dashboard structure is complete with placeholder data. Ready for backend integration.

---

## 1. Data Sources & Integration Strategy

### Primary Questions:
1. **Cliniko/Nookal Integration:**
   - What are the current API rate limits and quotas for Cliniko/Nookal?
   - Are we using webhooks, polling, or a hybrid approach for data synchronization?
   - What's the data freshness SLA we can realistically achieve?
   - Do we have sandbox/test environments for both platforms?

2. **Data Ownership & Storage:**
   - Are we storing copies of Cliniko/Nookal data locally, or fetching in real-time?
   - What's our data retention policy and compliance requirements (HIPAA, GDPR)?
   - How do we handle data conflicts between our system and the source PMSs?

3. **Multi-Clinic Support:**
   - How do we handle clinics that use different PMS systems?
   - What's our tenant isolation strategy for multi-clinic deployments?
   - Are there any PMS-specific data model differences we need to account for?

### Development Trap Alert:
- **Avoid:** Tight coupling to specific PMS APIs without abstraction layers
- **Risk:** API changes from Cliniko/Nookal breaking our entire system
- **Mitigation:** Implement adapter pattern with versioning strategy

---

## 2. Real-Time Data & "Live" Experience

### Current Frontend Requirements:
- Live data indicator with pulsing animation
- "Last updated" timestamps
- Real-time metric updates (Total Bookings, Active Patients, etc.)

### Critical Questions:
1. **WebSocket/Real-Time Strategy:**
   - Are we implementing WebSocket connections for live updates?
   - What's our fallback strategy if WebSocket connections fail?
   - How do we handle reconnection logic and state synchronization?

2. **Data Freshness:**
   - What's the maximum acceptable latency for "live" data?
   - Are we using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for one-way updates?
   - How do we handle partial data updates vs full refreshes?

3. **Scaling Real-Time:**
   - How many concurrent WebSocket connections can we handle?
   - What's our strategy for horizontal scaling of real-time features?
   - Are we using Redis for pub/sub or similar message broker?

### Development Trap Alert:
- **Avoid:** Overwhelming frontend with too frequent updates
- **Risk:** Memory leaks from unclosed WebSocket connections
- **Mitigation:** Implement proper connection pooling and throttling

---

## 3. API Design & Data Modeling

### Current Data Points Required:
```typescript
// Clinic Overview Metrics
interface ClinicMetrics {
  totalBookings: number
  totalBookingsChange: number // percentage
  activePatients: number
  newPatients: number
  dailyAverage: number
  missedAppointments: number
  missedAppointmentsPercentage: number
  bookingTrends: BookingTrend[]
  peakHours: PeakHour[]
}

// Time-based filtering
interface MetricsRequest {
  period: 'week' | 'month'
  startDate: string
  endDate: string
  clinicId: string
}
```

### API Design Questions:
1. **REST vs GraphQL:**
   - Are we using REST or GraphQL for the dashboard APIs?
   - What's our caching strategy for frequently accessed data?
   - How do we handle batch requests for multiple metrics?

2. **Data Aggregation:**
   - Are metrics pre-computed or calculated on-demand?
   - What's our strategy for handling different time zones?
   - How do we handle historical data for trend analysis?

3. **Pagination & Filtering:**
   - What's the maximum data set size we'll return in a single request?
   - Are we implementing cursor-based or offset-based pagination?
   - How do we handle complex filtering (date ranges, clinics, patient types)?

### Development Trap Alert:
- **Avoid:** N+1 queries when fetching related data
- **Risk:** Slow API responses due to complex aggregations
- **Mitigation:** Implement proper database indexing and query optimization

---

## 4. Performance & Scalability

### Performance Requirements:
- Dashboard must load within 2 seconds

   - How do we handle cache invalidation for real-time data?
   - What's our cache warming strategy for new clinics?

3. **Background Processing:**
   - Are we using job queues for heavy computations?
   - What's our strategy for handling failed background jobs?
   - How do we monitor and alert on processing delays?

### Development Trap Alert:

3. **Data Protection:**
   - Are we implementing field-level encryption for sensitive data?
   - What's our key management strategy?
   - How do we handle data anonymization for analytics?

### Development Trap Alert:
- **Avoid:** Storing sensitive data in logs or error messages
