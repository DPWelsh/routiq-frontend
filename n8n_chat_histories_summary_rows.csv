[2025-06-16 18:00:22] USER: Ah ok- I think Allister was referring to 15:00 today, where there may have been a potential cancellation, as opposed to tomorrow. If that’s no longer the case, I was just keen to check a few questions:

- Following a suspected partial rupture of the right Achilles/ calf muscle as diagnosed by an orthopaedic last Thursday, I have been able to bear full weight on the leg and even walk (*very* slowly), alongside being able to point the toes in all angles when laying down and perform full rotations of the ankle. I cannot however stand on tip toes. Does this mean it is likely a grade 1 or 2 rupture?
- ⁠I have bruising appearing around the ankle only really visible as of yesterday and more pronounced today (so day 4 and 5 after the trauma), with no bruising really visible on the calf. Does this mean this is isolated to a partial rupture of the Achilles?
- ⁠The swelling around the right Achilles is definitely visible compared to my left. If I continue to ice it today and wear a compression stocking whilst travelling, do you think that would be ok to get me through the 17 hour trip (2hr 45 to Singapore, 90 minute stop over, 12 hr 45 to Amsterdam)? I am just thinking about the time in a pressurised cabin. I could of course do any range of exercises and fortunately will be travelling in business class too, so can keep the bed flat/ ankle above the heart as much as possible, with the stocking on

Sorry I know this is not ideal to ask over a phone, but really appreciate any thoughts you may have on this.

Thanks so much in advance and again, happy to pay for any level consultation as needed
[2025-06-16 17:43:44] AI: I'm really sorry, Will, but Alister doesn't have any telehealth slots available at 15:15 tomorrow. The next earliest appointments are from 23 June onwards. Just so you know, the first 15-minute online assessment is free of charge, and if you'd like a more comprehensive session after that, we can sort out payment details then.\n\nSince you're flying soon, if you have any urgent questions or want a bit of tailored advice for your journey, feel free to let me know here—I'm happy to pass them straight to Alister so you get support before your travels!

[2025-06-16 17:43:41] USER: Hey Allister- sure, I will be heading to a taxi at that point, if we maybe started it at 15:15, would that be possible? If so, fine to go ahead. If you could just let me know how much you charge and if there’s perhaps a payment link I could use? Thanks !
[2025-06-16 14:38:14] AI: Hi will I think I had one cancellation today at around the 3pm time. It is a spot for a full consultation. So if you would like that time, we can do a full online consultation  call. However , it will be the price of a standard consultation. Is that ok for you ?

[2025-05-20 01:43:54] USER: Howdy mate flying tonight! So happy days I’ll let you know Im due back to continue … also the last 10 days or so restarted the bent over rotating cable light and deadlifting light… the deadlift still bit on the iffy side as when I release the weight it’s that sorta sketchy through the hips and waste pain bif off balance

But overall have definitely improved just added Bulgarian lunges and other hip exercises to compensate
[2025-05-20 01:43:54] AI: It's great to hear that you're making progress! For general advice on exercises like deadlifts and Bulgarian lunges, it's important to ensure that you're performing them with proper form to avoid any additional strain or injury. Remember, if you're feeling any discomfort, particularly if it's more than moderate, it might be good to ease the load or modify your form.

Engaging in exercises like Bulgarian lunges and other hip-focused routines can help in balancing and strengthening your hip muscles, which is crucial for avoiding imbalances. If you experience persistent issues or pain during your workouts, it might be beneficial to discuss the specifics with a physiotherapist to ensure your technique and routine are suitable for your rehab goals.

Always listen to your body and adjust the intensity as needed. Stay safe and reach out if you need further guidance!
